# My DS Notes

This is a repository for my notes

To create a repository:

	• go to github and create a new repo

	• copy the ssh to the clipboard

	• go to the terminal and cd to the dir you want the repo to live in locally

	• $ git clone pbpaste

	• cd to the new directory

	• vim readme.md

	• create the readme and esc :wq to save the readme and return to the terminal

	• $ git add readme.md

	• It might be a good idea to '$ git status' to see what's in the add

	• $ git commit -m 'text to describe the commit'

	• $ git push	# This will push the commit to github
