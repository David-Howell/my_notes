# My DS Notes

This is a repository for my notes

To create a repository:

	• go to github and create a new repo

	• copy the ssh to the clipboard

	• go to the terminal and cd to the dir you want the repo to live in locally

	• $ git clone pbpaste

	• cd to the new directory

	• vim readme.md

	• create the readme and esc :wq to save the readme and return to the terminal

	• $ git add readme.md

	• It might be a good idea to '$ git status' to see what's in the add

	• $ git commit -m 'text to describe the commit'

	• $ git push	# This will push the commit to github

	•

#SQL

	Databases
	• RDBMA — Relational Database Management System

	• Database — sometimes used interchangably with a DBMS

	• There are SQL and NoSQL systems SQL is relational and has id's for each entry

	• SQL is a general language and is used in MySQL

	• Database Server — A computetr that runs the DBMS and stores the Data, Typically either on-premises or in the cloud

	•Database Client — MySQL Workbench — querys the server and gets the info from it

	• DDL — Data Definition Language — commands that chang the structure of the database or the DBMS itself or chand the structure of tables in the database.

	• DML — Data Manipulation Language — Used to insert, update, delete , and retrieve information from databases. we will be focusing on the retrieval part of this.

	
# Queries
	
	• WE use the Structured Query Language to interact with MySQL.
	•SQL is mde up of statements and commands sent to the server individuallt, with results sent back to the client. We often think of these statements as asking questions of the server' as in "who are the users neamed 'jason'?, "what movies were sold betweem May 5 and Octover 20?" , etc. Because of this, these statements are generally called queries. SQL commands fall into several different categories most notably, DDL and DML. Our focus willl be on the retrieval part of the data manipulation language.

	• Bad programmers worry about the code. Good programmers worry about data structures and their relationships

	•Data structures and the server side is the backbone of the data and how we can get to it
